	help
	  Choose this option to enable the ION Memory Manager,
	  used by Android to efficiently allocate buffers
	  from userspace that can be shared between drivers.
	  If you're not using Android its probably safe to
	  say N here.

config ION_SYSTEM_HEAP
	bool "Ion system heap"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the Ion system heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config ION_CMA_HEAP
	bool "Ion CMA heap support"
	depends on ION && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable CMA heaps with Ion. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config ION_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	bool "ION unmapped heap support"
	depends on ION && (ARM || ARM64)
	help
	  Choose this option to enable UNMAPPED heaps with Ion. This heap is
	  backed in specific memory pools, carveout from the Linux memory.
	  Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

	help
	  Dummy ION driver will create a unmapped heap from physical
	  location provided through CONFIG_ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_BASE and
	  CONFIG_ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_SIZE.

config ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_BASE
